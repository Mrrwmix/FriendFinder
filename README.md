# FriendFinder

## Description

"Friend Finder" is essentially a dating app, with a twist. I changed the "matches" to "pro wrestling friends"! Upon completing the survey, the user will see which pro wrestler matches the user's personality. This app features a Node server, routing, a home HTML page, a survey HTML page, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and validation.

## Methodology

Pro wrestler friends are found by comparing a given pro wrestler's personality traits with the user's personality traits.
